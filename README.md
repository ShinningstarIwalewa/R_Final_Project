# Data Programming with R project
This is my final project for the module: Data Programming with R. The project has three main parts; Analysis, R Package and Functions/Programming.

## Objectives
- Perform an exploratory analysis on a Covid-19 dataset from Nigeria. The analysis of the data should involve the use of graphical summaries, tables and
numerical summaries of the data

- Write a report for an R package,  Clearly summarising the purpose of the package, clearly demonstrating the functionality of some of the main functions in the package on appropriate data, clearly showing the code and output for the demonstration examples.

- Write an R function (or set of functions) that can be used to provide a statistical analysis of interest. Providing appropriate print, summary and plot methods for the output from the functions.

## Conclusions
The state in Nigeria with the highest number of Covid-19 cases is Lagos and the recovery rate is rate. The state in Nigeria with the lowest number of Covid-19 cases is Kogi state, their recovery rate is not as high as Lagos state.
